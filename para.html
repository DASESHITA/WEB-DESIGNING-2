A rainy day is a day that almost everyone loves, be it a small kid, an adult or an elderly person. Rain showers are awaited all year long. It is said that God showers his blessings on earth in the form of rain and infuses everything and everyone with delight. It is a sight to see the trees and plants drenched in rain appearing greener and brighter.

The clouds in the sky overcast the sun and give relief from the scorching heat on a rainy day. The weather on this day is extremely pleasant and such weather works wonders on our senses. It fills our heart with a joyous feeling. I just love rainy days.
