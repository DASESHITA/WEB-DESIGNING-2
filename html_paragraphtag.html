A paragraph is a short collection of well-organized sentences which revolve around a single theme and is coherent. A good paragraph expresses everything it has to say briefly.

A complete paragraph discloses everything as far as information is concerned without leaving any gaps. It does not end abruptly without offering a sensible conclusion.

To write a good paragraph you need an Introduction (key sentence), a Body (supporting sentence), and a Conclusion (closing sentence). In this post, we have added the top 25+ short paragraphs.
